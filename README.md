háček presents a physical installation, VR experience, and printed data maps. It employs data to inform an immersive installation while positioning it’s larger impact towards metaphors of networked landscape, security and wayfinding. The data used is taken from real network traffic logs, tracking hackers in real time as they race to be the first in line at the Shmoo Group website, pummeling the site with DDOS, port scans, and sneaky malware as they compete to be the first to get their hands on the prize. The valiant defenders deflect bots, cheats, and attacks at every turn as they try to keep the site online. háček is not just data visualizations or VR gaming in the formal sense—but more akin to abstractions and metaphorical art works that reflect the data, pieces potentially to be enjoyed entirely out of context.
